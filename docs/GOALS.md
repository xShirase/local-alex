# ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

## Why I'm Building This

- I want a secure, smart AI assistant that helps with:
  - Personal logistics (calendar, reminders, smart home)
  - Professional work (drafts, dashboards, integrations)
  - Routine automations via voice or chat
- I want this hosted on **my own hardware**, with **no SaaS reliance**
- My fiancÃ©e and I will both use it, with separate tools and permissions
